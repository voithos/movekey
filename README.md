# movekey

movekey is a tiny Chrome extension that registers some basic Vim-like movement
hotkeys.

It takes heavy inspiration from
[Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb),
but takes simplicity and minimalism as its goal. Ideally, by minimizing the
number of functions and shortcut keys it registers, it will also minimize the
number of sites that it conflicts with.

Available hotkeys:

```
j     scroll down
k     scroll up
d     scroll down half a page
u     scroll up half a page
gg    scroll to top of page
G     scroll to bottom of page
H     go back in history
L     go forward in history
yy    duplicate current tab
i     focus the first input element on the page
```
